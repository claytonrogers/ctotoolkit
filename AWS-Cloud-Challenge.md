# HYBRID CLOUD ARCHITECTURE CHALLENGE

### Brief
Imagine that you have just been hired to a company that is in the early stages of their adoption of AWS. Currently their architecture is a classic n-tier Web application running on infrastructure within their traditional corporate data center. The application also supports bulk updates of customer information on a regular basis. The company is about to kick off a large marketing campaign and is confident that they will experience significant, rapid growth in the next three to six months. The company CIO and senior architecture team engaged you to provide architectural recommendations in the following areas:

- How to scale their application to meet demand
- How to address the lack of Disaster Recovery
- Effective distribution of load
- How to architect for shared content storage, given the increased performance demands of the application
- Latency of content served directly from S3 or storage attached to EC2
- A self-healing infrastructure that recovers from failed service instances
- Security of data at rest and in transit
- How to cost-effectively manage the ingestion of increased customer updates on AWS
- How to connect their existing data center to the application on AWS, and then integrate this architecture with existing management systems

### Objective
**Recommend a scalable, elastic, and redundant architecture** that allows the company to organically grow. The architecture should specifically address the requirements/concerns as described above with a description of any assumptions made to determine the best solution.

### Deliverables
**Create a PDF document** no greater than three pages in length that clearly and succinctly presents an analysis of the company's requirements and your proposed architecture. Clearly state all assumptions made during the design, and explicitly state any referenced Amazon Web Services. 

The document should also contain an architecture diagram that details your solution, and that also annotates all AWS services used. AWS architecture icons can be downloaded from [http://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons]. You can also use services like [http://cloudcraft.co].  

Once complete, send an electronic copy of the document back for review.
